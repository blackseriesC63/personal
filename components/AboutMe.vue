          My name is Nizomiddin. I am 26 years old and I am a Junior Fullstack
          Developer with a solid foundation in creating and maintaining scalable
          websites. I am fluent in Russian, English, and Uzbek. I enrolled in
          Westminster University in Tashkent and after completing my second year
          in 2019, I moved to the USA. I lived in the USA for 4 years and
          returned last year. This diverse background has allowed me to gain a
          broad perspective and strong technical skills. I have studied
          programming languages such as C, Python, and JavaScript, as well as
          Node.js, Vue, Nuxt, and Vite. I have hands-on experience working with
          Node.js and Prisma, and I am also well-versed in major database
          systems, including MySQL, MongoDB, and Postgres. Additionally, I
          possess knowledge of JavaScript (ES6) and WebSocket, which enables me
          to efficiently perform various backend development tasks. My knowledge
          of technical English ensures clear communication in technical
          documentation and within team collaboration.
